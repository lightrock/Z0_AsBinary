# Characteristic Impedance Python

> Physics often treats a successful predictive formalism as though it were the machine itself. Shouldn't we know better than to allow that?

Python-first research instrument for testing whether the characteristic impedance
of vacuum behaves like an unusually generative information substrate inside the
published catalog of fundamental physical constants.

## What This Repo Is

This repository is a research instrument, not a completed proof.

It currently provides:

- A tested Python reproduction of the pre-2019 `Z0` circular-XOR loop result.
- A complete pre-2019 CODATA 2014 evidence chain with raw source text, parsed
  official rows, derived binary rows, and a bits-only corpus.
- Legacy BigCalc2 observations translated into GitHub-readable Markdown notes.
- A process-first / closure-machine doctrine map for interpreting what the code
  is testing and what it is not allowed to assume.
- A falsification-first roadmap: randomized controls, catalog-wide scans,
  precision tests, unit-translation tests, and null-result reporting.

## Research Posture

```text
Strong claim under test.
Small inspectable algorithm.
Full evidence chain in-tree.
Randomized controls required.
Null results welcome.
```

The project begins with one strong legacy observation and turns it into code,
tests, baselines, and failure conditions. It should not make stronger claims
until catalog-level and randomized-control tests are implemented.

## Current State

- The pre-2019 `Z0` circular-XOR loop result is reproduced in tested Python code.
- The information-first thesis and legacy BigCalc2 observations are captured in
  GitHub-readable Markdown notes, with companion HTML versions for local/static
  viewing.
- A complete pre-2019 CODATA 2014 evidence chain exists under `docs/codata/`,
  including the raw NIST-style source text, 336 parsed official rows, derived
  binary rows, and a bits-only corpus.
- A separate legacy physics-token catalog exists under `docs/tokens/` for the
  quark and hadron rows that BigCalc2 appended after the official CODATA table.
- CODATA documentation generation tools exist under `tools/codata/`.
- Unit tests cover the Z0 anchor, core bit operations, XOR loop behavior, and
  CODATA document generation.
- GitHub Actions runs the Python unit test suite on push and pull request.

The next major implementation step is catalog-level experimentation: scanning
all constants, building randomized controls, and producing reproducible reports
from code outputs rather than hand-written observations.

## Claim Under Test

This project tests the claim that the pre-2019 CODATA significant-digit
representation of the characteristic impedance of vacuum is not merely an
arbitrary decimal artifact. Under a minimal binary encoding and a minimal
circular XOR evolution, it appears to behave as an unusually generative seed
inside the catalog of physical constants.

The claim is not that the ohm is sacred. The claim is that the pre-2019
published `Z0` value may preserve a privileged information object whose
structure became harder to see after the 2019 SI redefinition changed the
exact/measured status of vacuum electromagnetic constants.

## Thesis

Mature physics compresses empirical reality into a finite symbolic catalog of
authoritative constants. Once a constant is published, its significant digits can
be treated as an information object.

The working hypothesis is that the characteristic impedance of vacuum is not
just another constant in that catalog. It may be the impedance boundary between
physical measurement and symbolic compression: a compact seed whose simple
binary evolution reconstructs or intersects an unusually large fraction of the
other published constant bit patterns.

That claim is testable.

## Core Experiment

1. Load pre-2019 CODATA constants as published significant-digit records.
2. Convert each constant's significant digits into a binary information object.
3. Generate four canonical orientations: forward, reverse, inverse, and inverse-reverse.
4. Evolve each seed as a circular XOR ring:

   ```text
   next[i] = current[i] XOR current[(i + 1) mod n]
   ```

5. Detect halt, loop, period, and generated orbit text.
6. Scan each orbit for other constant bit patterns.
7. Compare the characteristic impedance of vacuum (`Z0`) against all other constants and randomized controls.
8. Repeat under precision choices, unit translations, CODATA editions, and alternative encodings.

## Known Verified Result

The legacy observation uses pre-2019 CODATA:

```text
name:   characteristic impedance of vacuum
digits: 376730313461
bits:   101011110110110111000000110001011110101
len:    39
```

The current Python implementation verifies that the forward circular-XOR
evolution of this seed closes a loop at period `4095`:

```text
seed        = 101011110110110111000000110001011110101
period      = 4095
halted      = false
closed_loop = true
```

This is the first anchor result. The project should not make stronger claims
until the catalog-level and randomized-control tests are implemented.

## Falsification Criteria

This claim weakens or fails if:

- `Z0` does not outperform other constants under the same encoding and evolution.
- Randomized bitstrings with the same length and density perform comparably.
- Shuffled catalog controls perform comparably.
- The observed structure disappears under reasonable precision and unit transformation tests.
- Post-selection explains the apparent matches.
- The result depends on undocumented choices that cannot be preregistered and repeated.

## Evidence Chain

The project keeps the full pre-2019 source and derived binary evidence in-tree:

- [CODATA Evidence Chain](docs/codata/README.md) explains the conversion rule
  and rebuild process.
- [Pre-2019 CODATA 2014 Raw Text](docs/codata/pre-2019-codata-2014-raw.txt)
  preserves the raw NIST-style all-values text used as the import source.
- [Pre-2019 CODATA 2014 Source](docs/codata/pre-2019-codata-2014-source.md)
  preserves 336 official named/value/unit rows currently used by the project.
- [Pre-2019 CODATA 2014 Binary](docs/codata/pre-2019-codata-2014-binary.md)
  preserves the same rows with significant digits and binary forms.
- [Pre-2019 CODATA 2014 Bits Only](docs/codata/pre-2019-codata-2014-bits-only.txt)
  is the stripped corpus for pure bit experiments.
- [Legacy Physics Token Catalog](docs/tokens/legacy-physics-token-catalog.md)
  preserves the non-CODATA quark/hadron/convenience rows that BigCalc2 appended
  to its local NIST file so they could be treated like named bit tokens.
- [Z0 Orientation Geometry Report](docs/reports/z0-orientation-geometry.md)
  preserves the four canonical Z0 orientations, the known forward manual layout,
  and candidate natural traversals without treating them as proof.

The conversion rule intentionally uses the published value mantissa only:

```text
376.730 313 461... -> 376730313461 -> binary
6.626 070 040 e-34 -> 6626070040   -> binary
299 792 458        -> 299792458    -> binary
```

That rule ignores sign, decimal point, digit-grouping spaces, ellipsis,
uncertainty, unit, and exponent marker. This is not an accident; it is the
information-object hypothesis made explicit and testable.

Future reports must state which catalog they used: official CODATA only, legacy
tokens only, or a combined catalog.

## QLF / ZFA Admissibility Layer

The XOR orbit is only the generated substrate. The admissibility layer treats
selected generated bit windows as candidate QLF/ZFA objects, separate from raw
bits, tap-tape observations, and named token hits.

A candidate is admissible only when positive/action twists and negative/lift
twists balance to spectral gap zero. This is closer to the QLF / Quantum OS
idea than substring matching alone because it separates generated observations
from interpreted process/capability/proof-like objects.

This remains a hypothesis-testing scaffold, not a physics proof.

## Why Pre-2019 Z0 Matters

The 2019 SI revision is not treated here as a mere bookkeeping change. It is
treated as a change in the published information structure of the constants
catalog.

Before the revised SI, the vacuum electromagnetic constants occupied a different
definitional status. After the revision, the SI is defined through exact values
assigned to selected defining constants, including `c`, `h`, and `e`. Under that
regime, the vacuum magnetic permeability and the impedance of free space are no
longer fixed in the same way; they become tied to the measured fine-structure
constant.

This project therefore treats the pre-2019 `Z0` value as a historically specific
information object. The question is not whether a unit convention is sacred. The
question is whether the pre-2019 catalog preserved a compact symbolic seed that
is structurally special under simple computational tests.

## Methodological Context

The computational stance is close to the Wolfram-style lesson that very simple
programs can produce unexpectedly rich behavior. The rule used here is much
smaller than a physics model:

```text
circular binary seed -> XOR with one-bit rotation -> generated orbit
```

If that minimal rule produces non-random reconstruction behavior against a
catalog of physical constants, the next move is not rhetoric. The next move is
controls.

## Doctrine Map

### Core Project Notes

- [Information-First Position](docs/information-first-position.md) states the
  central thesis: physical constants are compressed information artifacts before
  they are physics classroom objects, and unit objections must be tested as
  encoding transformations rather than used as a dismissal.
- [Fundamental Pi](docs/references/fundamentalPi.md) asks what physical machine
  produces the closure represented by `π`, `2π`, phase, rotation, and emergent
  geometry, without treating the symbol as the substrate.
- [Maxwell Machine Completion Note](docs/references/maxwell-machine-completion-note.md)
  preserves the project posture that Heaviside gives the public interface of
  electromagnetism, while Maxwell preserves the unfinished machine question that
  `Z0` may help turn into testable information-substrate experiments.
- [Carver Mead, Pointer-Swap Closure, and Z0](docs/references/mead-pointer-swap-z0.md)
  connects Mead's phase-handshake electrodynamics to the pointer-swap closure
  model and reframes `Z0` as a possible catalog-visible impedance receipt of EM
  phase-matching, not as a sacred ohm value.

### Process / Closure Doctrine

- [Process-First Physics](docs/references/process-first-physics.md) captures the
  doctrine that process is already running, while space and coordinate time are
  rendered accounting layers of relation, delay, closure, persistence, and
  observer-facing records.
- [QGP, Boundary Receipts, and the Pancake Inversion](docs/references/qgp-boundary-receipts.md)
  records the high-energy version of the same audit: if the available receipt is
  sheet-like or boundary-like, reconstructed 3D geometry should not be silently
  promoted above the receipt as substrate.
- [Computational Process Lineage](docs/references/computational-process-lineage.md)
  compares Wolfram and 't Hooft as near process-first ancestors: one finds the
  universal walk / everything-generator, the other the machine-instinct, while
  both still need closure depth, pruning, persistence, and rendered observer
  geometry/time.
- [Friston, Free Energy, and the Closure Machine](docs/references/friston-free-energy-closure-machine.md)
  treats Markov blankets, active inference, and free-energy minimization as
  serious persistence machinery that still begins after an admissible system has
  already formed.
- [Quantum Structures of the Hydrogen Atom](docs/references/quantum-structures-hydrogen-atom.md)
  records the Dugić/Francom/Arsenijević structure-selection point: hydrogen is
  not merely electron plus proton in space, but a case where environment,
  operation, and access select the physically usable quantum structure.

### Theory BBQ / Critique Notes

- [Theory BBQ Lineup](docs/references/theory-bbq-lineup.md) is the concise index
  of process-first critiques and repairs across string theory, LQG, Wolfram,
  't Hooft, Wheeler, Tegmark, Everett, Einstein/GR, causal sets, thermodynamic
  gravity, Kitada/Dugić, Friston, Feynman, and related approaches.
- [String Theory, Holography, and the Closure Machine](docs/references/string-theory-closure-machine.md)
  argues that string/M-theory is best repaired as a holographic/geometric
  rendering language for finite closure, not as the substrate itself.
- [Loop Quantum Gravity and the Closure Machine](docs/references/lqg-closure-machine.md)
  treats LQG as a serious discrete receipt layer that still needs the deeper
  event machine: closure, admissibility, persistence, and process ordering.

### Legacy Reports

- [Legacy Genetic Sequence Analysis](docs/legacy-genetic-sequence-analysis.md)
  explains what the old BigCalc2 "gene" machinery was doing: circular tape
  decomposition, Z0-facet compression, ablation controls, and Z0-as-running-tape
  scans.
- [Legacy Physics Token Catalog](docs/tokens/legacy-physics-token-catalog.md)
  calls out the appended quark and hadron rows from BigCalc2, including their
  values, significant digits, and binary strings.
- [Z0 Orientation Geometry Report](docs/reports/z0-orientation-geometry.md)
  makes fixed bits, orientation, layout, traversal, and interpretation explicit
  before later quark genetic sequence decomposition work.
- [Z0 Binary Structure](docs/z0-binary-structure.md) captures the 2019 PDF/RTF
  observation that the characteristic impedance bits already contain whole
  quark mass-signature words, arrange naturally into a gluon-like chart, and
  come from a prime significant-digit integer with a primitive Pythagorean
  triple identity.

Note: the Markdown documents linked above are the GitHub-readable versions.
The companion HTML files in `docs/` are much nicer looking when opened locally
or through a static site, but GitHub's repository file browser shows them as
source code unless GitHub Pages or another static host is used.

## Design Posture

- Treat constants as information artifacts with provenance.
- Treat units as translations to be tested, not as automatic disqualifiers.
- Prefer small, inspectable algorithms over GUI-first exploration.
- Require randomized and cross-constant baselines before making strong claims.
- Keep generated reports separate from core library code.
