# Characteristic Impedance Python

Python-first research instrument for testing whether the characteristic impedance
of vacuum behaves like an unusually generative information substrate inside the
published catalog of fundamental physical constants.

## Status

This is an early research instrument, not a completed proof. The project begins
with one strong legacy observation and turns it into code, tests, baselines, and
failure conditions.

The current code reproduces the pre-2019 `Z0` circular-XOR loop result and
provides the scaffolding for broader catalog and control tests.

## Claim Under Test

This project tests the claim that the pre-2019 CODATA significant-digit
representation of the characteristic impedance of vacuum is not merely an
arbitrary decimal artifact. Under a minimal binary encoding and a minimal
circular XOR evolution, it appears to behave as an unusually generative seed
inside the catalog of physical constants.

The claim is not that the ohm is sacred. The claim is that the pre-2019
published `Z0` value may preserve a privileged information object whose
structure became harder to see after the 2019 SI redefinition changed the
exact/measured status of vacuum electromagnetic constants.

## Thesis

Mature physics compresses empirical reality into a finite symbolic catalog of
authoritative constants. Once a constant is published, its significant digits can
be treated as an information object.

The working hypothesis is that the characteristic impedance of vacuum is not
just another constant in that catalog. It may be the impedance boundary between
physical measurement and symbolic compression: a compact seed whose simple
binary evolution reconstructs or intersects an unusually large fraction of the
other published constant bit patterns.

That claim is testable.

## Core Experiment

1. Load pre-2019 CODATA constants as published significant-digit records.
2. Convert each constant's significant digits into a binary information object.
3. Generate four canonical orientations: forward, reverse, inverse, and inverse-reverse.
4. Evolve each seed as a circular XOR ring:

   ```text
   next[i] = current[i] XOR current[(i + 1) mod n]
   ```

5. Detect halt, loop, period, and generated orbit text.
6. Scan each orbit for other constant bit patterns.
7. Compare the characteristic impedance of vacuum (`Z0`) against all other constants and randomized controls.
8. Repeat under precision choices, unit translations, CODATA editions, and alternative encodings.

## Known Verified Result

The legacy observation uses pre-2019 CODATA:

```text
name:   characteristic impedance of vacuum
digits: 376730313461
bits:   101011110110110111000000110001011110101
len:    39
```

The current Python implementation verifies that the forward circular-XOR
evolution of this seed closes a loop at period `4095`:

```text
seed        = 101011110110110111000000110001011110101
period      = 4095
halted      = false
closed_loop = true
```

This is the first anchor result. The project should not make stronger claims
until the catalog-level and randomized-control tests are implemented.

## Falsification Criteria

This claim weakens or fails if:

- `Z0` does not outperform other constants under the same encoding and evolution.
- Randomized bitstrings with the same length and density perform comparably.
- Shuffled catalog controls perform comparably.
- The observed structure disappears under reasonable precision and unit transformation tests.
- Post-selection explains the apparent matches.
- The result depends on undocumented choices that cannot be preregistered and repeated.

## Why Pre-2019 Z0 Matters

The 2019 SI revision is not treated here as a mere bookkeeping change. It is
treated as a change in the published information structure of the constants
catalog.

Before the revised SI, the vacuum electromagnetic constants occupied a different
definitional status. After the revision, the SI is defined through exact values
assigned to selected defining constants, including `c`, `h`, and `e`. Under that
regime, the vacuum magnetic permeability and the impedance of free space are no
longer fixed in the same way; they become tied to the measured fine-structure
constant.

This project therefore treats the pre-2019 `Z0` value as a historically specific
information object. The question is not whether a unit convention is sacred. The
question is whether the pre-2019 catalog preserved a compact symbolic seed that
is structurally special under simple computational tests.

## Methodological Context

The computational stance is close to the Wolfram-style lesson that very simple
programs can produce unexpectedly rich behavior. The rule used here is much
smaller than a physics model:

```text
circular binary seed -> XOR with one-bit rotation -> generated orbit
```

If that minimal rule produces non-random reconstruction behavior against a
catalog of physical constants, the next move is not rhetoric. The next move is
controls.

## Initial Notes

- [Information-First Position](docs/information-first-position.md) states the
  central thesis: physical constants are compressed information artifacts before
  they are physics classroom objects, and unit objections must be tested as
  encoding transformations rather than used as a dismissal.
- [Legacy Genetic Sequence Analysis](docs/legacy-genetic-sequence-analysis.md)
  explains what the old BigCalc2 "gene" machinery was doing: circular tape
  decomposition, Z0-facet compression, ablation controls, and Z0-as-running-tape
  scans.
- [Z0 Binary Structure](docs/z0-binary-structure.md) captures the 2019 PDF/RTF
  observation that the characteristic impedance bits already contain whole
  quark mass-signature words, arrange naturally into a gluon-like chart, and
  come from a prime significant-digit integer with a primitive Pythagorean
  triple identity.

Note: the Markdown documents linked above are the GitHub-readable versions.
The companion HTML files in `docs/` are much nicer looking when opened locally
or through a static site, but GitHub's repository file browser shows them as
source code unless GitHub Pages or another static host is used.

## Design Posture

- Treat constants as information artifacts with provenance.
- Treat units as translations to be tested, not as automatic disqualifiers.
- Prefer small, inspectable algorithms over GUI-first exploration.
- Require randomized and cross-constant baselines before making strong claims.
- Keep generated reports separate from core library code.

## Roadmap

- Reproduce the legacy `Z0` XOR-ring period result. Done.
- Add catalog loading for pre-2019 CODATA constants.
- Add orientation, period, and orbit scans across the full constants catalog.
- Add shuffled-bit, random-seed, and alternate-constant baselines.
- Add unit-translation and precision-cut experiments.
- Generate reproducible Markdown/HTML reports from code outputs.
- Publish null results and failed variants alongside positive results.
